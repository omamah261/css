CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside
its own box and uses rules to indicate how thatelement
 should look.CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.

 Color:
-There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
_ Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
_ It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
_CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
_CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
